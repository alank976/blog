Today, I decided to re-pick up learning Rust and the primary focus will focus on WebAssembly after inspiring a few read recently. But before that, I think reorganizing a bit what I had done so far might sound a good idea to help me refresh what I had learnt. So, this blog would talk about the toy projects I made in 2020-2021 ðŸ˜…wow, almost 2 years since the first one. Didn't realize that until now! Let's talk about these 3 toys I played with ðŸ‘€


## [todo-service](https://github.com/alank976/todo-service)

In this project, the primary goal is to act as a RESTful API to serve CRUD requests for TODO items. I didn't aim to deploy this thing to any cloud so it was targeted to runwith its required infrastructure in a docker-compose environment only. The infrastructures are namely, just Postgres and Flyway for table schema bootstrapping. See more in the [docker-compose.yaml](https://github.com/alank976/todo-service/blob/master/docker-compose.yaml).

Then, in rust realm, the main libraries/frameworks I had used:
- actix web: to host a HTTP server
- serde: serialize/deserialize JSON payloads (not surprising)
- sqlx: to talk to Postgres in a generic way instead of other Postgres-specific library

### 1st Challenge: inconsistent async runtime
During writing this blog, I can still recall those frustrations I felt when I firstly saw the "Bring your own async runtime" thing. The HTTP server framework Actix has its own async runtime, while the sqlx uses async-std. I stuck with the "get started" guide from official Actix website so actix-rt and kept sqlx plain vanilla without async-std. This is one of the biggest :question: I have with Rust's async ecosystem... (Now I found sqlx supports also `runtime-actix-native-tls` feature flag I guess)

### 2nd Challenge: Dependency injection?
Thanks to my previous OOP experiences, soon after I found I modeled this toy project exactly like Spring framework does, using handlers as controllers, repository for persistence-related codes. Managing multiple "beans" like these isn't an easy job, so a dependency injection library/framework is the answer usually. However, Rust is not really an OOP language, though it has similar "inheritance" concept but pretty different from its nature.
