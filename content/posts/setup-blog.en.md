# Setting up a personal blog with Github Pages, Hugo and PaperMod

I decided to write blog posts to log my learning experiences as a tool of reflection. Apparently, open source stuff is preferred since I don't want to pay for it. 

## [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
I heard that Github Pages is able to host static website easily via converting some markdown into HTMLs. And actually, I had given it a shot long long time ago for my [resume](https://alank976.github.io/markdown-resume) with Jekyll. The experience is not bad, just that I had to tweak some HTML/CSS templates from time to time when I need to customize stuff. Not much to complain given it's free. And again, it's powered by Github. It's techy ðŸ¤“, and so it's sexy :joy:
