I joined [a k8s challenge event organized by DigitalOcean in December 2021](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/pages/kubernetes-challenge) that I couldn't quite recall how I came across its ads üòÖAnyways, I picked one of the suggested topics:
> Deploy a virtual cluster solution
>
> Install vcluster to test upgrades (eg. 1.20 to 1.21 DOKS version) of your cluster. With a virtual cluster, you can create a new Kubernetes cluster inside your existing DOKS cluster, test the application in this new vcluster, and then upgrade your original cluster if everything works well with the new version.

I only have experience allocating namespaces per team/bounded context in my past and current day jobs. Although sharing cluster-wide resources like ingress controller is never a concern to us (yet, maybe?), it sounds interesting that I could see how things go virtualized on top of a well-known platform built for virtualization :joy: So I gave [vcluster](https://www.vcluster.com/) a shot.

I peeked at a bit other participants' work to gain some insight about how they illustrated their installation steps and learnings. Some used Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform but I know nothing about it at all. That goes to the dummiest approach - words and GIFs üòÖ: https://github.com/alank976/doks-vcluster-challenge. Click into it if you are interested in what I had done :wink:

It was a great experience and I am grateful that DigitalOcean offered those topics and also CNCF and their cloud platform credits üí∞. It is not much but I contributed nothing, learnt something, and took something away üòè.

What do you guys think about this spinner toy? Should I spend my credit on this little thing? I suspect the delivery fee might go beyond the credit I earned :joy:.
